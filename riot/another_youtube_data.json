Bloodhound Heirloom was unlocked from a free case that was recieved from the Season 3 Battle Pass, the Lifeline Heirloom was unlocked when i purchased the 24 Apex Packs necessary to unlock all the skins from the event plus the Heirloom. Afterwards, having leftover Apex Coins, decided to actually purchase 14 more cases and on the very last case, unlocking the Wraith's Heirloom.
